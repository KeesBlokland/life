## üöß IN PROGRESS - Core Legacy Features

### Document Grouping System
**Goal:** Group related files into logical documents (e.g., passport = front + back pages)

**Database Changes Required:**
```sql
-- New documents table
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    modified_date TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add document_id to files table
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN document_id INTEGER REFERENCES documents(id);
```

### üîê Essential: Contacts & Credentials System
**Goal:** Secure storage of vital login information and contacts for family access

**Database Schema Required:**
```sql
-- Contacts/Organizations table
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'person', 'company', 'government', 'utility', 'financial'
    contact_type TEXT, -- 'family', 'friend', 'service', 'account'
    created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    modified_date TIMESTAMP
);

-- Contact details (phone, email, address)
CREATE TABLE contact_details (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    contact_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    detail_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'phone', 'email', 'address', 'website'
    label TEXT, -- 'home', 'work', 'mobile', 'billing'
    value TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (contact_id) REFERENCES contacts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Credentials (encrypted storage)
CREATE TABLE credentials (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    contact_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    service_name TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'Online Banking', 'Tax Portal', 'Electric Company'
    website_url TEXT,
    username TEXT,
    password_encrypted TEXT, -- Encrypted with family recovery key
    password_hint TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    last_used DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (contact_id) REFERENCES contacts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**Essential Categories:**
- **Government:** Tax portals, social security, DMV, voter registration
- **Financial:** Banks, credit cards, investment accounts, retirement
- **Utilities:** Electric, gas, water, internet, phone, trash
- **Insurance:** Health, car, home, life insurance portals
- **Family/Friends:** Emergency contacts, important relationships
- **Services:** Doctors, lawyers, accountants, repair services

**Key Routes to Add:**
- `/contacts/browse` - List contacts by category
- `/contacts/view/<id>` - Contact details with credentials
- `/contacts/add` - Add new contact/organization
- `/contacts/edit/<id>` - Update contact information
- `/credentials/add/<contact_id>` - Add login credentials

## üö® IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

### 1. Bin Display Improvements (MINOR - DO FIRST)
**Problem:** Calendar shows generic "Bin" text, requiring clicks to identify bin type

**Required Changes:**
- Update event titles to show "Blue Bin", "Yellow Bin", etc.
- Add bin-specific background colors in calendar (blue events for blue bins)
- Modify `temp_add_event.html` bin selection to auto-update title
- Update calendar CSS with bin color classes
- One glance shows all bin types without clicking

**Files to Modify:**
- `temp_add_event.html` - Update bin type selection JavaScript
- `temp_calendar.html` - Add bin color classes to events
- `styles.css` - Add bin-specific event colors
- `bp_main.py` - Ensure bin type stored in event description/title

### 2. Calendar Overcomplification - CRITICAL REALIZATION
Problem: Spent entire day trying to fix complex calendar widgets when user wanted simple event list
Root Issue: Engineer asked for "show events in chronological order" - I built calendar grids, month boundaries, 4-week periods
Simple Solution Needed:

Events = rows in table with dates
Query: SELECT * FROM events WHERE date >= today ORDER BY date LIMIT 20
Display: Simple chronological list (like homepage "Upcoming" section but longer)
Navigation: "Show More" / "Show Previous" buttons
Format: Jun 17: Brown Bin, Green Bin | Aug 25 2026: Birthday

User's Valid Engineering Logic:

Walk through the table
Display what you find
Don't overthink it
Events are just data, not calendar widgets

What NOT to build:

Complex calendar grids
Month boundary logic
4-week period calculations
Navigation that breaks when crossing months

Tomorrow: Build simple chronological event list, not calendar widgets
Files to Create/Modify:

Simple events list template (chronological, not calendar grid)
Backend: Basic date-ordered query with pagination
Remove broken calendar navigation complexity

Key Lesson: User asked for bicycle, I built broken rocket ship. Keep it simple.



### 2. Calendar Recurring Events Issues
**Problem:** Recurring bin entries appearing on unwanted days, not editable, invisible until day selected

**Required Fixes:**
- **Recurring Events Management Page**
  - List all recurring events with ability to edit/delete
  - Route: `/calendar/recurring` 
  - Show frequency, next occurrence, created date
  - Bulk delete option for problematic entries

- **Calendar Event Type Distinction**
  - Differentiate between one-time and recurring events in UI
  - Recurring events show different color/icon
  - Edit recurring: "This occurrence only" vs "All occurrences"
  - Better recurring event creation form

- **Refuse Bin Logic Fix**
  - Review automatic bin event creation
  - Ensure settings-based bins don't create database entries
  - Clear separation between settings-based and user-created events

### 3. Shopping Lists CRUD Missing
**Problem:** Can add items but cannot edit, delete, or manage existing entries

**Required Fixes:**
1. **Full CRUD Operations**
   - Edit item names and quantities
   - Delete individual items
   - Mark/unmark as "common items" for quick re-adding
   - Bulk operations (clear completed, delete all)

2. **Enhanced List Management**
   - Multiple shopping lists (grocery, hardware, etc.)
   - List templates for common shopping trips
   - Print-friendly view for shopping

**Routes to Add:**
- `/lists/edit/<item_id>` - Edit shopping item
- `/lists/delete/<item_id>` - Delete shopping item  
- `/calendar/recurring` - Manage recurring events

**Timeline:** After contacts system  

**Tasks:**
1. Database schema changes with migration
2. Upload interface for document creation
3. Document browser interface
4. File navigation within documents
5. Admin CRUD for document management

### Phase 2: Raspberry Pi Integration
**Goal:** Portable backup and recovery system  
**Timeline:** After document grouping complete  

**Tasks:**
1. Pi setup with identical web interface
2. Sync scripts (rsync over SSH)
3. Self-imaging automation
4. Dropbox integration
5. Family recovery instructions

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Goal:** Enhanced digital legacy features

## üîí Security Considerations for Credentials

**Encryption Strategy:**
- Passwords encrypted with family recovery key (separate from admin password)
- Recovery key stored in multiple secure locations
- Option for time-delayed access (emergency situations)

**Access Levels:**
- **View Only:** Family can see usernames and hints
- **Emergency Access:** Full credentials with recovery key
- **Admin Access:** Full CRUD operations

**Backup Strategy:**
- Encrypted credential export for external storage
- Family recovery instructions with key location
- Multiple backup locations (Dropbox, USB drives, printed guides)

This updated specification reflects the current state and maintains the original vision while acknowledging practical implementation evolution.
